# Global-PB Translator - Translation system for the Global Pratham Books Project

This repository is a fork of the [gasp-translator](https://github.com/dohliam/gasp-translator) project with the goal building an easy-to-use and accessible translation system to automate the process of translating [Pratham Books](http://prathambooks.org/) stories into other languages for [Global-PB](https://github.com/global-asp/global-pb).

It has deliberately been kept as minimal as possible to allow translators to focus on the translation with as little distraction as possible.

You can visit the live Translator tool [here](https://global-asp.github.io/pb/translator).

## Usage

To begin translating stories, just click on the "Translate!" button at the bottom of the page. This will open up a story from the [African Storybook Project](http://africanstorybook.org/) collection, with empty space on the right for you to enter your translation.

Make sure to enter your name and the language you are translating into at the top of the page. Your work will be released under the same Creative Commons license as the original story, and you will be credited for attribution using the name you select here. You can edit either field at any time, e.g. if you want to change the way you are attributed or translate into a different language.

## More information

For further details on using the translator or on the data format used here, see the [gasp-translator](https://github.com/dohliam/gasp-translator) project.
